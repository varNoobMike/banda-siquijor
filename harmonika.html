      <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">Brief History</h2>

      <p>Formed in <strong>2022</strong> in the heart of Siquijor, Harmonika began as a humble <strong>garage
          band</strong> jamming alternative rock in their neighborhood. Everything changed when the group stumbled upon
        <strong>Jay Mark "Macky" Tamiat</strong> —singing reggae classics on a karaoke machine at a local gathering.
        Captivated by his soulful voice and natural stage charm, they quickly brought him in as their lead vocalist.
        This moment sparked the transformation from casual jam sessions to the official formation of Harmonika, setting
        the foundation for their signature style: youthful, relatable, and full of heart.
      </p>

      <p>Though their musical arrangements are often simple, Harmonika has built a reputation for their effective
        delivery and emotional sincerity. Their stage presence is driven by energy and authenticity, making each
        performance feel personal and alive. The band blends reggae, pop, and rock influences into feel-good sets that
        resonate with both young and old, creating a sound that’s easy to sing along with and hard to forget.</p>

      <p>Today, Harmonika is one of the most active and beloved bands in Siquijor. Whether playing on a beach stage, in
        a lively bar, or at community events, they consistently bring a positive vibe that unites crowds. Their
        story—from garage beginnings to crowd-favorite performers—is a testament to how talent, timing, and passion can
        turn simple moments into a lasting musical journey.</p>

      <p><strong>Harmonika</strong> began their musical journey deeply rooted in <strong>reggae and ska</strong>,
        bringing upbeat rhythms and island-style grooves to the local stage. Their early performances were marked by
        relaxed yet infectious energy, making them a favorite for beachside gigs and lively community events. Reggae and
        ska formed the foundation of their identity, shaping their vibe and musical flow from the very beginning.</p>

      <p>As the band grew and gained experience, they gradually expanded their setlist to include a variety of other
        genres. <strong>Party pop</strong>, acoustic ballads, OPM hits, and even <strong>danceable medleys</strong>
        became part of their repertoire, allowing them to cater to a wider range of audiences and event types. This
        shift didn’t replace their reggae roots—it simply gave their performances more flavor and flexibility.</p>

      <p>Today, Harmonika is known for their smooth blend of reggae, ska, and variety music. Their sets can move from a
        chill reggae tune to a powerful pop chorus or a mellow acoustic song, depending on the crowd and mood. This
        versatility, combined with their youthful stage presence and authentic sound, makes every Harmonika performance
        vibrant, engaging, and uniquely their own.</p>
